1). The command from flask_cors import CORS, cross_origin is used in Flask applications to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) 
support. CORS is a mechanism that allows web browsers to make requests to a web application hosted on a different domain than 
the one from which the web page was served. This is important for web applications because it enables them to interact with resources 
from different origins securely.

2). The line app = Flask(__name__) in a Flask application creates an instance of the Flask class, which represents the Flask 
application itself. __name__: This is a special Python variable that represents the name of the current module. When Python runs a 
script, it sets the __name__ variable of the script's module to '__main__' if the script is being executed as the main program. 
If the script is being imported as a module, __name__ is set to the name of the module. By passing __name__ to the Flask constructor, 
you're telling Flask to use the name of the current module to determine where to look for templates, static files, and other resources.

3). So, when you write app = Flask(__name__), you're creating a new Flask application instance and storing it in the variable app. 
This instance will be used to configure and run your Flask application. You can then define routes, register blueprints, set 
configuration options, and more using this app object. It's essentially the heart of your Flask application.
